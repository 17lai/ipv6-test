<h1>[% "FAQ on \"Buggy DNS\"" | i18n %]</h1>

<p>[% "If you were referred to this page by test-ipv6.com, it means that we were able to detect a dangerous condition with your DNS server." | i18n %]</p>
<p>[% "First a description of the problem:" | i18n %]</p>
<ul>
    <li>[% "Your browser asked for a DNS lookup, both IPv4 and IPv6." | i18n %]</li>
    <li>[% "The IPv6 response was returned first." | i18n %]</li>
    <li>[% "Your DNS server was confused by the result - it doesn't fully follow the DNS standards." | i18n %]</li>
    <li>[% "Your DNS server took the first piece of the IPV6 address, and memorized it as the IPv4 address." | i18n %]</li>
    <li>[% "The browser fails the IPv6 lookup, but \"succeeds\" in getting a bogus IPv4 address." | i18n %]</li>
    <li>[% "It then tries to make a connecting, to the wrong address, with the wrong protocol." | i18n %]</li>
</ul>

<p>[% "This is bad for several reasons:" | i18n %]</p>

<ul>
    <li>[% "You won't be able to connect to IPv6-only sites." | i18n %]</li>
    <li>[% "You may sporadically fail (or always fail) to connect to IPv6-enabled web sites.  This is regardless of whether you are capable IPv6 or not - you may still be impacted." | i18n %]</li>
    <li>Malicious people can recognize that specific IPv6 addresses, when matched with this bug, map to IPv4 addresses they control.
    Web sites you depend on can be spoofed; you would not know any better, unless the sites are using SSL.</li>
</ul>

<b>[% "So, what is actually affected?" | i18n %]</b></p>

<p>[% "You'll need to determine what device is forwarding your DNS queries." | i18n %]</p>

<p>[% " With Windows, at the <code>cmd</code> prompt, you can type <code>ipconfig /all</code>.  Look for \"<code>DNS Servers</code>\". " | i18n %]</p>
<p>[% " With Linux, BSD, and Mac OS X, you can do this in a terminal:  <code>cat /etc/resolv.conf</code>. " | i18n %]</p>
<p>[% " Residential ISP customers: look to see if the DNS server is <b>192.168.0.1</b> or <b>192.168.1.1</b>.  If so, chances are good that your home router is at fault.  This is probably the blue box you have that connects the Internet. " | i18n %]</p>
<p>[% " Business customers: Provide this information to your IT professional to investigate. " | i18n %]</p>

<b>[% "IT professionals:" | i18n %]</b></p>

<p>[% "You can see an illustration of this, by doing:" | i18n %]</p>

<pre><code>
dig aaaa buggydns1.test-ipv6.com  @192.168.1.1
dig a buggydns1.test-ipv6.com @192.168.1.1
</code></pre>

<p>[% " Substitute the 192.168.1.1 with the resolver being used by the host. If the \"aaaa\" request comes back with no answer, but the \"a\" answer does, this is a confirmation of a broken DNS cache or forwarder.  The actual DNS information for buggydns1.test-ipv6.com has only an IPv6 record configured. " | i18n %]</p>
