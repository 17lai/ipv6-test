   <p><em>The following has been duplicated from the <a href="http://www.worldipv6launch.org/faq/">World IPv6 Launch</a> FAQ page, hosted by <a href="http://www.internetsociety.org">the Internet Society</a> (ISOC).</em></p>


<div class="question">
What is World IPv6 Launch?
</div>
<div class="answer">
<p>Organized by the Internet Society, World IPv6 Launch on 6 June 2012 is
intended to motivate organizations across the industry – including Internet
service providers (ISPs), hardware makers, and web companies – to prepare
for and permanently enable Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) on their
products and services as Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) address space
runs out.

<div class="question">
How is this different from World IPv6 Day?
</div>
<div class="answer">
<p>World IPv6 Launch will mark the largest industry commitment to and
deployment of IPv6 in the history of the Internet, with ISPs, home
networking equipment manufacturers and web companies around the world
permanently enabling IPv6 within their products and services.</p>
<p>Specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>ISPs participating in the World IPv6 Launch will enable IPv6 for enough
users so that at least 1% of their residential wireline subscribers who
visit participating websites will do so using IPv6</li>
<li>Participating home networking equipment manufacturers will enable IPv6
by default through their range of home router products</li>
<li>Web companies participating in World IPv6 Launch will enable IPv6 on
their main websites permanently</li>
</ul>
<p>World IPv6 Day only involved websites. Last year, major web companies and
other industry participants successfully enabled and tested IPv6 on their
main websites for 24 hours on World IPv6 Day, which was held on 8 June 2011.
</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
Why only 1%? of residential wireline subscribers?
</div>
<div class="answer">
<p>The goal is to reach 1% by June. In many cases, users may need to upgrade or
replace hardware and software, such as operating systems or home routers, to
use IPv6. Over time, as users upgrade, IPv6 adoption will increase without
any changes in the ISP’s service or equipment.
</p></div>


<div class="question">
What is IPv6 and why do we need it?
</div>
<div class="answer">
<p>The Internet operates by transferring data between networks in packets. In
order to communicate and send/receive packets of data, each host, computer
or other device connected to the Internet must be identified by a unique IP
address. IPv4 has approximately four billion IP addresses (the sequence of
numbers assigned to each Internet-connected device). The explosion in the
number of people, devices, and web services on the Internet means that IPv4
is running out of space. IPv6, the next-generation Internet protocol which
provides more than 340 trillion, trillion, trillion addresses, will connect
the billions of people not connected today, allow a huge range of devices to
connect directly with one another, and help ensure the Internet can continue
its current growth rate indefinitely.</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
Why is World IPv6 Launch necessary?
</div>
<div class="answer">
<p>The address space used by the current version of the Internet protocol,
IPv4, is expected to run out in the near term. Without action, we risk
increased costs and limited functionality online for Internet users
everywhere, in addition to curtailing the Internet’s growth of a platform
for innovation and economic development. The only long-term solution to this
problem is adoption of IPv6, which provides a practically unlimited number
of addresses. IPv6 is used extensively in many large networks, but it has
never been enabled for end users at a global scale.
</p>
<p>World IPv6 Launch helps industry stakeholders work together to support the
new protocol on an accelerated timeline. With major ISPs, home equipment
manufacturers, and web companies permanently enabling IPv6 by this year’s
World IPv6 Launch on 6 June 2012, there are strong incentives for other
industry players also make a commitment to permanent transition to IPv6 in
the near future.
</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
How does World IPv6 Launch help motivate change?
</div>
<div class="answer">
<p>World IPv6 Launch acts as a focal point to bring existing transition efforts
and industry players together, to work towards the common goal of
permanently deploying IPv6 on the global Internet. By acting together on the
World IPv6 Launch, ISPs, web companies, and equipment vendors are able to
cooperatively address common challenges.</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
What still needs to happen for the entire industry to effectively transition
to IPv6?
</div>
<div class="answer">
<p>More major Internet industry players must take action to ensure a
successful transition, including offering IPv6 connectivity to users,
providing services over the IPv6 network, and updating software and
firmware. While the technical foundations of IPv6 are well established,
significant work remains to deploy IPv6 across the globe.</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
What can organizations do to join World IPv6 Launch?
</div>
<div class="answer">
<p>We welcome additional participants to join this year’s World IPv6 Launch.
Find out how to participate by visiting <a href="http://www.worldipv6launch.org">http://www.worldipv6launch.org</a>.
</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
How will this impact my everyday Internet usage?
</div>
<div class="answer">
<p>Most Internet users will not be affected. Internet users should enjoy
uninterrupted service. In rare cases, users may still experience
connectivity issues when visiting participating Websites. Users can visit an
<a href="http://test-ipv6.com">IPv6 test site</a> to check if their connectivity will be impacted. If the test
indicates a problem, they can disable IPv6 or ask their ISPs to help fix the
problem. A <a href="http://netalyzr.icsi.berkeley.edu/">more detailed network connectivity
check</a> is also available.
</p>

<p>
As ISPs enable IPv6, and home gateway products support it, users at home
with modern operating systems and devices will start using IPv6
automatically. In particular, Windows Vista, Windows 7, and Mac OS X 10.7
support IPv6.
</p>

<p>You can check your home router’s documentation to see if it support’s
IPv6, and contact your ISP to ask if IPv6 is deployed in your service area.
</p>

<p>It is important to note that participating websites will continue to
support access over IPv4. You shouldn’t worry if you aren’t able to obtain
access to the IPv6 Internet. World IPv6 Launch will simply introduce IPv6 in
parallel to IPv4.
</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
What can Internet users do to get ready for World IPv6 Launch?
</div>
<div class="answer">
As ISPs enable IPv6 and home gateway products support it, users at home with
modern operating systems and devices will start using IPv6 automatically.
The majority of users shouldn’t notice the transition at all. IPv4 access
will still be available as companies permanently enable IPv6 on their
products and services.
</div>

<div class="question">
What are participating web companies doing to warn users and customers?
</div>
<div class="answer">
<p>Last year, many of the participants in World IPv6 Day published warning
information (including messages on their home pages) to users that they
thought might suffer problems. We haven’t decided exact details yet, but we
won’t be leaving users in the cold.</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
What can individuals do to support World IPv6 Launch?
</div>
<div class="answer">
<p>Join the cause and spread the word by downloading and using the World IPv6
Launch badge: <a href="http://www.worldipv6launch.org/downloads">http://www.worldipv6launch.org/downloads</a>
