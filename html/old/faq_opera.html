<p>Our full test is not reliable for Opera users.  We provide an alternative below; otherwise please use another browser.

<h2>Alternative test for Opera users..</h2>

<p>This image based test is provided as a workaround.
It will give you a quick pass/fail test, to tell
you if you should be worried for World IPv6 Day.

<h2>If you have problems..</h2>

<p>
    If the second image (dual stack) fails to load for you, it can mean one of several things.  Make sure your version of Opera is <b>11.10</b> or newer.  If you are already using the latest version, you can visit our <a href="broken.html">"broken users"</a> FAQ, which has a checklist of things to try.
</p>

<h2>If you want to run the full test</h2>

<p>
      If you <b>really</b> want to try the newer test with Opera,
<a href="index.html?opera=1">click here</a>.   Unfortunately, it is expected to fail.

<h3>Technical details running the real test with Opera</h3>

<p>jQuery and dynamic &lt;script&gt;  statements
(jQuery.json).  In this case, the error handler is not always called.
If the jQuery.jsonp query fails, Opera instead shows this on the debug console:
<code>"Uncaught exception: TypeError: Cannot convert 'jQuery('#_jqjsp1')[0]' to
object; Error thrown at line 1, column 0 in ...".</code>  This particular
bug is spurious - it does not always happen.  But I can't seem to make it
stop, either.</p>
